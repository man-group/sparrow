  # P0355R7 (Extending chrono to Calendars and Time Zones) has not been entirely implemented in libc++ yet.
  # See: https://libcxx.llvm.org/Status/Cxx20.html#note-p0355
  # For now, we use HowardHinnant/date as a replacement if we are compiling with libc++.
  # TODO: remove this once libc++ has full support for P0355R7.
